# Kachofugetsu ~ 花鳥風月
## Project Overview
Kachofugetsu is a turn-based role-playing card strategy game in ukiyo-e art style. This is an on-going solo project I started from April. The two main characters, Goemon (whom the player will play as) and Fujiko (the NPC) will have a memory-match game for fun.
